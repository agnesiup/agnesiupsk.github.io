Again for this project we had to make a story board before shooting the video. And again having the storyboard done was extremely helpful and made the rest of the process go faster. It was a bit complicated at the beginning, because trying to make user get interested about rules is never an easy task. But once we were done, we couldn’t be more happy. Our team had defined target audience very clearly – that was the reason why our shooted are exactly the way they are. <br><br>Before that, I didn’t think that every movement, every sound has to be considered to its final details. If I had to film something again, I wouldn’t do a thing without first creating a proper storyboard.
