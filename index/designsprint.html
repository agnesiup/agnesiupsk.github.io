    In the theme Design Sprint we were given a task to considert about the way about improving Fronter whick is the most used platform while studying. In groups, we had to distinguish one feature we would like to work on the most on and create the XD prototype for it.<br><br> 
Our group could not decide which feature is more significant – the ability chat in a forum, which was defined as “Buzz” page or viewing other students (both former and latter) portfolios through their profiles. So we chose to do both! In this project I have worked with particularly companionable and enthusiastic people – we talked about the task a lot and were involved deeply into it. Because of that, the result was well studied. <br><br>
I have deepened my communication skills when talking with people who have completely different ideas. Also, I have learned how to create animation when using Adobe XD.
