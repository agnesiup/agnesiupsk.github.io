    Link to the site is a result of all the work in a group which lasted for a couople of weeks. Here we had to present our task which was mainly a video about how to bike in Copenhagen. Or, in our case, <i>videos</i>. We had to use both CSS and JS. <br><br>I have learned a lot during this group project. First of all, I have what found out color corrector and white balance is and how to fix it. Also I have learned how to use Adobe Premiere. This app seemed to be highly confusing and frihtening from the first glance, but the more I used it, the more I have started to enjoy the whole process of it. One more following thing I have realised was the fact that if you are a designer and you use Adobe apps a lot, a good computer is a must to own. And thanks to the topic â€“ now I theoreticaly know the essentials of how to bike in Copenhagen.
